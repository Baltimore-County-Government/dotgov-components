A section is container for content.

## Default

```jsx
<Section>
  <p>Some content goes here</p>
</Section>
```

If you aren't using react, you'll need to use the following html:

```html
<section class="dg_section"><p>Some content goes here</p></section>
```

## Dark Section

```jsx
<Section className="dark">
  <p>Some content goes here</p>
</Section>
```

If you aren't using react, you'll need to use the following html:

```html
<section class="dg_section dark"><p>Some content goes here</p></section>
```
